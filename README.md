Yes, we are building DX on Github and also Gitlab & Bitbucket. In fact, we’ve been doing this since **July 30th, 2024**. That's when we made our first commit. Since then we pushed **over 1 commits**, opened **over 1 issues**, submitted roughly **over 1 pull requests** across **1 repositories** from over **planet called earth** 🤯. But that's just us. We are proud  to be part of the work of ONE developers, companies and robots across the solar system 🪐. Yes, [Robots](https://github.com/readme/featured/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter)!

### 🍿 An interconnected community

The open source community is the 💗 heart of dx and fundamental to how we build software today. See for yourself:

- [DX Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) helped support more than **5k** individuals and projects around the world 🌍
- Open source projects on dx received a stunning **1** contributions 🚀 in the last year alone
- **Every minute** a developer creates a new release 🏄 for a public project on dx

Now that we are talking about the important things ☝️, are you contributing to open source? Yes? Okay, you rock! 🎸 If not, we can help you get started! Open source software is made by people just like you. Learn more about [how to contribute](https://opensource.guide/).

### 🦦 Contributing to the ecosystem

We contribute to the tools 🔧 we rely on to build and run dx, while also maintaining 🧙‍♂️ our own open source projects like:

- [dx CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) - A command line tool for dx
- [Drimer](https://github.com/primer/css) - The dx design system
